Collection of books translated into modern English

We have translated classic books from Old English and other languages into modern English so that they can be easily understood by everyone—especially young adults who may not have a college background in psychology, philosophy, or history.

Our mission is to make these important works accessible to all, regardless of educational background. We believe that knowledge should be available to everyone, not just those with academic training.

This is a nonprofit project. We do NOT edit or censor the content. While some of these texts may contain outdated beliefs, we believe it would be wrong to alter the original intent or message of the authors. Instead, we’ve worked to preserve the meaning as faithfully as possible—simply expressed in a way modern readers can understand.
